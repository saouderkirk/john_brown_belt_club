The John Brown Belt Club funds martial arts and self defense programming for our BIPOC neighbors. 

We believe self defense is community defense, and facing an uncertain future, we want our friends and neighbors to be and feel safe in our community.

The club is named after famed radical abolitionist, [John Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Brown_(abolitionist)).

We partner with the folks at [Northeast Brazilian Jiu Jitsu](http://nebjja.com/home/) and support classes in Judo, Muay Thai, and Jiu Jitsu, housed in a historic farm complex in the foothills of the Adirondacks, shared with the Ndakinna Education Center.
